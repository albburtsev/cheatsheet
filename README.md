## Why?

Unfortunately, my memory isn't perfect and very selective. If I don't use something for a long time, I lose the ability to remember and take advantage of it.

So, I've decided to try something new (actually not) to solve this problem.

Let's review tested possible solutions before:

### Improve your memory

You can try to improve your memory with [exercises](https://www.lumosity.com/), [healthy food](https://www.google.ru/webhp#newwindow=1&q=brain+food) or even [medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic). But, based on my experience, these things don't expand «memory cache» dramatically. **If you don't use some knowledge for a long time, you will forget about it.** This is an axiom for me and for the most people.

### Write in blog

It really works! The algorithm looks easy:

1. Find a topic where you don't have a solid knowledge
2. Spend time for studying
3. Try to write blog post about it (actually, try to share your new knowledge to people)
4. Get solid understanding of your topic, because of teaching lead to deeper studying
5. Get blog post that you can read anytime you want

Yeah, it really works, but! This approach required to much time and efforts. Writing correct and interesting text is hard. Especially when you want to write in English and you are not native speaker ;)

### Write notes

Notes, summary, synopsis or any other type of text which you can read later. It **almost** works for me.

But I want to keep all these notes in one place.

And I want to use concise and comfortable markup language (Markdown).

And want keep code examples nearby.

And want to have a comfortable web interface for reading.

Wait a minute, it looks like well-structured repo in Github!

## Conclusion

This repo is an experiment. Maybe I throw it after two weeks or maybe it will be a basis for future blog posts. Let's find out...
