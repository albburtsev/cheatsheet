## Why?

Unfortunately, my memory isn't perfect and very selective. If I don't use something for a long time, I lose the ability to remember and take advantage of it.

So, I've decided to try something new (actually not) to solve this problem.

Let's review some possible solutions before:

### Improve your memory

You can try to improve your memory with [exercises](https://www.lumosity.com/), [healthy food](https://www.google.ru/webhp#newwindow=1&q=brain+food) or even [medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic). But, based on my experience, these things don't expand «memory cache» dramatically. **If you don't use some knowledge for a long time, you will forget about it.** This is an axiom for me and for the most people.
